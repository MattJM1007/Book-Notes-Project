# Book Notes Capstone Project

This is my book notes project for Angela Yu's Full Stack Web Developer Course on Udemy.

The objective of this project was to apply knowledge from PostgreSQL to create a database where you can add, edit, and read notes/reviews on books. 

## To run this project:
- You will need to create a postgres database called 'books' (or whatever you like, just update the server.js)
- Create the tables and add some data. I have provided my SQL queries in 'queries.sql' which you can use to setup the table, as well as the queries used in the server file.
- run `npm i` to instsall all of the packages
- you will have to update the password to your password in the const db in the server.js file
- start the server with nodemon
